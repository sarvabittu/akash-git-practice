# Terraform Interview Questions:

![Terraform](https://www.techgeeknext.com/img/terraform/terraform-logo.png)

### Q. What is Terraform?
Answer:Terraform is a tool for creating, updating, and versioning infrastructure securely and efficiently. Terraform is capable of managing both current and popular service providers, as well as custom in-house solutions. Configuration files notify Terraform which components are required to run a single application or an entire datacenter.

Terraform helps you Manage All of Your Infrastructure as Infrastructure as Code and promote Self-Service Infrastructure allows you to construct infrastructure as needed :

- Terraform code is written in the HCL programming language.
- Stop constructing things by hand.
- Put everything into a Terraform setup that can be repeated.
- All of the build steps are now written in code.
- It's a lot easier if you ever have to rebuild something!

### Q. What are the key features of Terraform?
Answer:Below are the key features of Terraform:
- Infrastructure as Code: A high-level configuration syntax is used to define infrastructure.
- Execution Plans: Terraform generates an execution plan during the "planning" phase.
- Resource Graph
- Change Automation 

### Q. What are most useful terraform commands?
Answer: 
![Terraform Workflow](https://k21academy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Terraform_Workflow-2048x983.jpg)
```
terraform init    # Initialize the current directory
terraform plan    # Dry run to see what Terraform will do
terraform apply   # Apply the Terraform code and build stuff
terraform destroy # Destroy what was built by Terraform
terraform refresh # Refresh the state file
terraform output  # View Terraform outputs
terraform graph   # Create a DOT-formatted graph
```

### Q.What is Terraform Cloud? ANd its different versions available?
Answer:Terraform Cloud is a hosted application that includes remote state management, API-driven runs, policy management, and other capabilities. Many users prefer a SaaS solution that is hosted in the cloud since they do not want to manage the infrastructure required to run it.

- __Terraform Enterprise___ is the same tool, but it runs in your own data centre or cloud environment. Some users want more control over the Terraform Cloud application, or they want to execute it behind corporate firewalls in restricted networks.
- ___Terraform Cloud for Business___ uses the same hosted environment as Terraform Cloud, but with additional features for larger teams. Single sign-on, audit logging, and the ability to Terraform on-premise resources from the cloud are just a few of the features available.

### Q. How does Terraform work?
Answer: Terraform creates an implementation plan, defines what it will do to achieve the desired state, and then executes it to build the infrastructure described. Terraform is capable of determining what changed and generating incremental execution plans that are practical as the configuration changes.

### Q. How to check the installed version of Terraform?
Answer: We can use terraform -version of the command to identify the version which we are running.

### Q. Define Terraform init?
Answer: Terraform initialises the code with the command terraform init. This command is used to set up the working directory for Terraform configuration files. It is safe to run this command multiple times.

You can use the init command for:
- Installing Plugins
- Installation of a Child Module
- Initialization of the backend

### Q. What are the ways to lock Terraform module versions?
Answer: You can use the terraform module registry as a source and specify the attribute’version’ in the module in a terraform configuration file. If you are using the GitHub repository as a source, you must use ‘? ref’ to specify the branch, version, and query string.

### Q. What are the key features of Terraform?
Answer: Following are the key features of Terraform:

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform’s high-level configuration language is used to define your infrastructure in human-readable declarative configuration files.
You may now create an editable, shareable, and reusable blueprint.
Terraform generates an execution plan that specifies what it will do and asks for your approval before making any infrastructure alterations. You can assess the modifications before Terraform creates, updates, or destroys infrastructure.
Terraform creates a resource graph while simultaneously developing or altering non-dependent resources. Terraform can now build resources as quickly as possible while also giving you more information about your infrastructure.
Terraform’s the automation of change allows you to apply complex changesets to your infrastructure with little to no human interaction. Terraform recognises.

### Q. What are the use cases of Terraform?
Answer: Following are the use cases of Terraform:
- Setting Up a Heroku App:
Heroku is a popular platform as a service for hosting web applications (PaaS). Developers first create an app, then add add-ons such as a database or an email service. One of the best features is the ability to scale the number of dynos or workers as needed. Most non-trivial applications, on the other hand, quickly necessitate a large number of add-ons and external services.
Terraform can be used to codify the configuration of a Heroku application, ensuring that all necessary add-ons are present, but it can also go beyond, such as configuring DNSimple to set a CNAME or Cloudflare as the app’s CDN. Best of all, Terraform can accomplish all of this in under 30 seconds without the use of a web interface.
- Clusters of Self-Service: 
A centralised operations team overseeing a large and expanding infrastructure becomes extremely difficult at a certain organisational level. Implementing “self-service” infrastructure, which allows product teams to manage their own infrastructure using tooling provided by the central operations team, becomes more appealing.
Terraform configuration can be used to keep track of how a service is built and scaled. You can then share these settings with the rest of your company, allowing client teams to manage their services using Terraform.
- Quick Creation of Environments: 
It is common to have both a production and a staging or quality assurance environment. These environments are miniature versions of their production counterparts, and they are used to test new programmes before they are released to the public. Maintaining an up-to-date staging environment becomes increasingly difficult as the production environment grows larger and more involved.
Terraform can be used to codify and share the production environment with staging, QA, and development. These parameters can be quickly used to create new testing environments that can be easily discarded. Terraform, which allows parallel environments to be created and destroyed on the fly, can help to alleviate the difficulty of maintaining them.
- Schedulers of Resources:
Static application assignment to computers becomes increasingly difficult in large-scale infrastructures. Among the schedulers that can help with this challenge are Borg, Mesos, YARN, and Kubernetes. These can be used to schedule Docker containers, Hadoop, Spark, and a variety of other software applications dynamically.
Terraform isn’t just for Amazon Web Services and other physical service providers. Terraform can request resources from resource schedulers because they can be viewed as providers. Terraform can now work in layers, such as deploying the physical infrastructure that powers the schedulers and provisioning into the scheduled grid.
- Demonstrations of software:
In today’s world, software is becoming increasingly networked and distributed. Although virtualized demo environments can be created with tools such as Vagrant, displaying software on real infrastructure that closely replicates production environments remains difficult.
A Terraform configuration can be used by software authors to design, provision, and bootstrap a demo on cloud providers such as AWS. End users can simply demo the application on their own infrastructure, and configuration options such as cluster size can be changed to evaluate tools at any scale.

### Q. How to create a SSH in Terraform when using AWS?
Answer: SSH private keys for Terraform can be created using tls_private_key
```
variable "terraform_key" {}

resource "tls_private_key" "example" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits  = 4096
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "generated_key" {
  terraform_key   = var.terraform_key
  public_key = tls_private_key.example.public_key_openssh
}

data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["0977"] # Canonical
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  terraform_key      = aws_key_pair.generated_key.terraform_key

  tags {
    Name = "Terraform Example"
  }
}
```

### Q. How to upgrade terraform to a specific version ?
Answer: After installation using brew install tfenv for installing terraform we can select the specific version -
```
$ tfenv list-remote

### Q. How to set up a lambda function triggered by a scheduled event source when using Terraform?
Answer: This can be achieved using aws_cloudwatch_event_target as follows -
```
resource "aws_lambda_function" "check_javainuse" {
    filename = "check_javainuse.zip"
    function_name = "checkFoo"
    role = "arn:aws:iam::424242:role/something"
    handler = "index.handler"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "check_every_ten_minutes" {
    name = "every-ten-minutes"
    description = "Fires every ten minutes"
    schedule_expression = "rate(10 minutes)"
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_target" "check_javainuse_every_ten_minutes" {
    rule = ""
    target_id = "check_javainuse"
    arn = ""
}

resource "aws_lambda_permission" "allow_cloudwatch_to_call_check_foo" {
    statement_id = "AllowExecutionFromCloudWatch"
    action = "lambda:InvokeFunction"
    function_name = ""
    principal = "events.amazonaws.com"
    source_arn = ""
```

### Q. How to make use of AND/OR operators in Terraform?
Answer: Terraform has no defined binary types. How ever we can make use of Simple math for [interpolations (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.1.x/configuration-0-11/interpolation#math).
```
count = signum( + )
```

### Q. How to attach AWS managed policies to a role for Terraform?
Answer: This can be achieved using Data Source: [aws_iam_policy](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/iam_policy.html)
```
data "aws_iam_policy" "ReadWriteAccess" {
  arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadWriteAccess"
}
```
### Q. How to index all attributes when using DynamoDB with Terraform ?
Answer: This can be achieved using the [AttributeDefinition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_AttributeDefinition.html)
```
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "test-javainuse" {
  name           = "javainuse-table-name"
  read_capacity  = 5
  write_capacity = 5
  hash_key       = "javainuse-attribute"

  attribute {
    name = "javainuse-attribute"
    type = "S"
  }
}
```

### Q.How does Terraform help in discovering plugins?
Answer: Terraform interprets configuration files in the operational directory with the authority “Terraform init.” Then, Terraform determines the necessary plugins and searches for installed plugins in various locations. Terraform may also download additional plugins at times. Then it decides which plugin versions to use and creates a security device file to ensure that Terraform uses the same plugin versions.

### Q. What is module in terraform?
Answer: A module is a container for several resources that are used in conjunction with one another. Modules can be used to construct lightweight abstractions, allowing you to define the infrastructure in terms of architecture instead of physical objects.

- A Terraform module is a set of Terraform configuration files contained within a single directory. Or a basic configuration with a single directory having one or more .tf file is a module. When Terraform commands are run directly from such a directory, it is referred to as the root module.

In this way, each Terraform configuration is a module. You may have a basic collection of Terraform configuration files like:
```
.
|--- LICENSE
|--- README.md
|--- main.tf
|--- variables.tf
|--- output.tf
```

### Q. What is Private Module Registry?
Answer: Terraform Cloud provides a Private Module Registry, which allows you to store, version, and distribute modules to your organisations and teams.

### Q. What is main.tf in terraform?
Answer: main.tf contains the primary configuration for your module. You can also build additional configuration files and arrange them in some helpful way for your project. Variable definitions for your module will be stored in variables.tf.

### Q. How do you call a main.tf module?
Answer: When you run terraform plan or terraform apply, the.tf files in your working directory combine to form the root module. This module will call other modules and bind them by transferring output values from one to input values from another.


### Q. What language does terraform use?
Answer: Terraform configuration syntax is known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It is designed to be both human-readable and editable, as well as machine-friendly. Terraform can also read JSON configurations for machine-friendliness.

### Q. How does terraform integrate with github and public cloud?
Answer:The majority of businesses are migrating to the public cloud. Managing infrastructure in a secure and controlled manner is a critical step for businesses.

Check out this [Terraform + GCP + Git Complete Example](https://www.techgeeknext.com/cloud/terraform-gcp-github-example) to learn how to use terraform to provision infrastructure on Cloud while keeping the infrastructure code in a github repository.

### Q. What is Terraform State?
Answer: Terraform keeps track of the resources it has created in a state file. This crucial file contains all of the information Terraform requires to change, update, and delete infrastructure.

The state file is saved in your local workspace by default. We can use Terraform Cloud to store the state file as a Remote State on the cloud.

### Q. What are the disadvantages of maintaining the Terraform state file on the local machine?
Answer: 
- State file sometimes contains secrets or sensitive data may be exposed
- We are unable to collaborate with the team because the file is on someone's laptop.
- On a local machine, there is a possibility of losing or deleting the state file.
- There is no centralised record keeping to track historical developments.

### Q. What exactly is Sentinel?
Answer: Sentinel is the policy enforcement language used by HashiCorp. Sentinel policies are validated when the Terraform plan is executed. Sentinel will detect incorrect settings before they reach production, not later.

![Sentinel Policy](https://www.techgeeknext.com/img/terraform/terraform-sentinel-policy.png)

We can choose the scope of Sentinel policies that will be enforced at the Organization or Workspace level.
```
# Restricting region in GCP
google_region_valid = rule {
  all region_values as rv {
    rv == "us-west-1"
  }
}
```

### Q. What exactly do you mean when you say Policy-as-Code?
Answer: 
- Treat policies as applications
- Store in version control
- Proactive vs. reactive
- Automate enforcement and review
- Automate logic testing

### Q. Can you provide few examples where we can use for Sentinel policies?
Answer: Sentinel is a powerful tool that can be used to implement a variety of policies. Here are a few examples:
***Security Standards***
- Forbid or allow only certain resources, providers or data sources
- Restrict roles the cloud provider can assume
- Restrict roles the cloud provider can assume

***Audit Tracking***
- Review an audit trail for Terraform Cloud operations
- Enforce explicit ownership in resources

***Resource Restriction***
- Limit the size of VMs and clusters for cost
- Enforce mandatory tagging on resources built with Terraform
- Restrict modules to your organizations Private Module Registry

### Q. What are the various levels of sentinel enforcement?
Answer: Sentinel is a powerful tool that can be used to implement a variety of policies. Here are a few examples:
***Advisory :***
- Logged but allowed to pass
- When a user triggers a plan that violates the policy, an advisory is issued to the user.

***Soft-Mandatory :***
- Teams based permissions for overrides
- Overrides logged for audit if the policy fails
- Prevents non-compliant infrastructure from being deployed by regular users. Only administrators have the ability to overrule.

***Hard-Mandatory :***
- Default enforcement level
- The policy must pass
- Only way to override is to explicitly remove the policy
- Prevents non-compliant infrastructure from being deployed by all users and apps.

### Q. Why write tests for Sentinel policies?
Answer:
- Policies and infrastructure are prone to change for refactoring.
- Writing tests assures that your policy will continue to work as intended even if things change.
- Writing testing instils trust in the policymaking process.

### Q. How to Store Sensitive Data in Terraform?
Answer: In order to communicate with your cloud provider's API, Terraform requires credentials. Although config files and environment variables are a preferable alternative, the credentials are still saved in plaintext on your desktop.

*Every day, GitHub is exposed to thousands of API and cryptographic keys! Protecting sensitive variables such as Cloud API Keys, Passwords, SSH private keys, SSL certificates, and other sensitive text or data is critical. So these API keys should never be stored in terraform code directly.*

Sensitive Variable is Secure Place for API Credentials : Terraform Cloud can securely store and encrypt your passwords. This encrypted storage can be used to store passwords, TLS certificates, SSH keys, and anything else that shouldn't be stored in plain text.

### Q. How can terraform plan aid in the development process?
A. Validates your expectations against the execution plan without permanently modifying state
B. Initializes your working directory containing your Terraform configuration files
C. Formats your Terraform configuration files
D. Reconciles Terraformג€™s state against deployed resources and permanently modifies state using the current status of deployed resources
Answer: A (Readmore from [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19235)


### Q. Imagine you have a Terraform module that deploys an application to a single server instance. How would you modify the module to deploy the application to multiple server instances?
Answer: You can modify the Terraform module to deploy the application to multiple server instances by using a loop in the resource definition. For example, you could use a count parameter to specify the number of server instances to deploy and then use the count.index variable to reference each instance in the resource definition.

### Q. You are working on a Terraform project that needs to provision an S3 bucket, and a user with read and write access to the bucket. What resources would you use to accomplish this, and how would you configure them?
Answer: To provision an S3 bucket and a user with read and write access to the bucket, you can use the aws_s3_bucket and aws_iam_user resources in Terraform. You can then use the aws_iam_user_policy_attachment resource to attach a policy to the user that grants them read and write access to the bucket. Here is an example of how you could configure these resources:

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket"
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "my_user" {
  name = "my-user"
}

resource "aws_iam_user_policy_attachment" "my_policy_attachment" {
  user       = aws_iam_user.my_user.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess"
}
```

### Q. How do you manage sensitive data in Terraform, such as API keys or passwords?
Answer: Terraform provides several ways to manage sensitive data, including using environment variables, using the Vault provider, and using the SSM parameter store. One common way to manage sensitive data is to use environment variables, which can be referenced in the Terraform code using the "${var.VARIABLE_NAME}" syntax. The actual values of the variables can be stored securely in a separate file or managed by a separate tool.

### Q. Suppose you are working on a project that requires provisioning a new VPC with a public and private subnet. How would you write the Terraform code to accomplish this task?
Answer: To provision a new VPC with a public and private subnet, you can use the aws_vpc, aws_subnet, and aws_internet_gateway resources in Terraform. Here is an example of how you could configure these resources:

```
resource "aws_vpc" "my_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

resource "aws_subnet" "private_subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
}

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "my_gateway" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id
}

resource "aws_route_table" "public_route_table" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id

  route {
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.my_gateway.id
  }
}

resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_association" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public_subnet.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public_route_table.id
}
```

### Q. How would you recover from a failed apply in Terraform?
Answer: You can save your configuration in version control and commit it before making any changes, and then use the features of your version control system to revert to an earlier configuration if necessary. You must always recommit the previous version code in order for it to be the new version in the version control system.

### Q. What do you mean by Terragrunt, list some of its use cases?
Answer: Terragrunt is a lightweight wrapper that adds tools for maintaining DRY configurations, working with multiple Terraform modules, and managing remote states.

Use cases:

- Keep your Terraform code DRY
- Maintain a DRY remote state configuration.
- Keep your CLI flags DRY
- Run Terraform commands on multiple modules at the same time.
- Use multiple AWS accounts.

### Q. What steps should be followed for making an object of one module to be available for the other module at a high level?
Answer: The following are the steps to take in order to make an object from one module available to the other module at a high level:

- First, in a resource configuration, an output variable must be defined. The scope of local and to a module is not declared until you declare resource configuration details.
- You must now declare the output variable of module A so that it can be used in the configurations of other modules. You should create a brand new and current key name, and the value should be kept equal to the module A output variable.
- You must now create a file variable.tf for module B. Create an input variable inside this file with the same name as the key you defined in module B. This variable in a module enables the resource’s dynamic configuration. Rep the process to make this variable available to another module as well. This is due to the fact that the variable established here has a scope limited to module B.

### Q. What is State File Locking?
Answer: State file locking is a Terraform mechanism that prevents operations on a specific state file from being performed by multiple users at the same time. Once the lock from one user is released, any other user who has taken a lock on that state file can operate on it. This aids in the prevention of state file corruption. The acquiring of a lock on a state file in the backend is a backend operation. If acquiring a lock on the state file takes longer than expected, you will receive a status message as an output.

### Q. What is a Remote Backend in Terraform?
Answer:  [Terraform](https://k21academy.com/cloud-infrastructure-automation-certification-terraform-associate-self-study-training/) remote backend is used to store Terraform’s state and can also run operations in Terraform Cloud. Multiple terraform commands such as init, plan, apply, destroy (terraform version >= v0.11.12), get, output, providers, state (sub-commands: list, mv, pull, push, rm, show), taint, untaint, validate, and many more are available via remote backend. It is compatible with a single remote Terraform cloud workspace or multiple workspaces. You can use terraform cloud’s run environment to run remote operations such as terraform plan or terraform apply.

### Q. What is a Tainted Resource?
Answer: Tainted resources are those that must be destroyed and recreated upon the next apply command. Nothing changes on infrastructure when you mark a resource as tainted, but the state file is updated with this information (destroy and create). After marking a resource as tainted, Terraform plan out will show that the resource will be destroyed and recreated, and the changes will be implemented when the next apply occurs.

### Q. Are callbacks possible with Terraform on Azure?
ANswer: Terraform uses Azure Event Hub to perform Azure callbacks. It aids in achieving functionality such as sending a callback to the system and other events. To make the process easier, Terraform AzureRM already includes this functionality.

### Q. How to prevent Error Duplicate Resource
ANswer: It can be done in three ways depending on the situation and the requirement

1) By deleting the resource, Terraform code will no longer manage it.

2) By removing resources from APIs

3) Importing action will also aid in resource elimination.

### Q. Explain the workflow of the core terraform.
ANswer: Terraform’s core workflow has three steps:
Write – Create infrastructure in the form of code.
Plan – Plan ahead of time to see how the changes will look before they are implemented.
Apply – Create a repeatable infrastructure.

Except for some early bootstrapping in the root package, when a user launches the terraform programme, execution immediately jumps into one of the command package’s “command” implementations (not shown in the diagram). The commands store the mapping between user-facing command names and their corresponding command package types. The go file is located in the repository’s root directory.

The command implementation’s responsibility for these commands is to read and parse any command line arguments, command-line options, and environment variables required for the specified command and use them to construct a backend. object of operation The operation is then passed to the currently selected backend.

**Backends:**

A backend in Terraform is responsible for a number of things:

Execute operations (e.g. plan, apply)
Variables defined in the workspace can be saved.
to store the current state
The local backend retrieves the current state for the workspace specified in the operation using a state manager (either statemgr.Filesystem if the local backend is used directly, or an implementation provided by whatever backend is being wrapped), and then uses the config loader to load and perform initial processing/validation of the configuration specified in the operation. It then creates a terraform.context object using these parameters as well as the other parameters supplied in the process. The main object performs terraform operations.


**Configuration Loader :**

Model types represent the top-level configuration structure in package configs. Config represents a configuration (the root module and all of its child modules). Although the configs package contains some low-level functionality for creating configuration objects, the configload is the primary entry point. Loader can be found in the configload subpackage. A loader handles all of the complexities associated with installing child modules (during terraform init) and then locating those modules when a configuration is loaded by a backend. It takes the path to the root module and loads all of the child modules recursively to produce a single configuration.

**State Manager:**

The state manager is in charge of storing and retrieving snapshots of a workspace’s Terraform state. Each manager implements a subset of the interfaces provided by the statemgr package, with the majority of managers covering the entire set of statemgr. Complete operation. The smaller interfaces are commonly used in other function signatures to specify what actions the function may take on the state manager; there is no reason to create a state manager that does not implement all of statemgr. Full.

**Graph Builder:**

The terrain. The Context method calls a graph builder. A graph builder is used to represent the fundamental phases of that action, as well as the dependencies between them. Because of the differences in the graph-building process, each operation has its own graph builder. For a “plan” operation, a graph must be constructed directly from the configuration, whereas a “apply” action constructs its graph from the set of alterations mentioned in the plan being applied.

**Graph Walk:**

The graph walking method explores each vertex of the graph while keeping the graph’s “happens after” edges in mind. Every vertex in the graph is evaluated so that the “happens after” edges are taken into account. The graph walk algorithm will evaluate multiple vertices at once if possible.

**Vertex Evaluation:**

Execution refers to the action taken for each vertex during a graph walk. Execution performs a set of random operations that are appropriate for the vertex type in question. Before the graph walk can begin evaluating other vertices with “happens after” edges, a vertex must be correctly completed. When one or more errors occur during evaluation, the graph walk is paused, and the errors are returned to the user. questions for terraform interviews

### Q. Differentiate between Terraform and Cloudformation.
Answer: 
![Terraform and Cloud Formation](https://miro.medium.com/max/843/1*6xmUBOOJgMPbAy8tmqxQyw.png)

- **User-friendliness:** Terraform works with a variety of Cloud Service Providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others, whereas CloudFormation only works with AWS services. Terraform covers the vast majority of AWS resources.

- **Depending on the language:** CloudFormation supports JSON and YAML. CloudFormation is now simple to grasp and apply. AWS developers, on the other hand, are not permitted to create CloudFormation templates larger than 51MB. If the size of a template exceeds this limit, the developers must create a layered stack for it.

Terraform, on the other hand, makes use of Hashicorp’s own HCL programming language (Hashicorp Configuration Language). This language is also JSON-compatible.

- **State-management:** Because CloudFormation is an AWS managed service, it inspects the infrastructure on a regular basis to ensure that it is in good working order.If anything changes, CloudFormation receives a detailed response.
Terraform, on the other hand, stores the state of the infrastructure on the provisioning machine, which can be a virtual machine or a remote computer. Terraform defines the resources it maintains using the state as a map, which is saved as a JSON file.
To summarise, CloudFormation manages Cloudformation’s state by default, preventing conflicting changes. Terraform saves the state to a local disc, making state synchronisation easier. Terraform states can also be saved in storage services such as S3, which is a recommended additional state management strategy. This must be defined on the backend to facilitate and secure management.

- **Cost:** The best part is that both of these programmes are completely free. Both of these technologies have sizable online communities that provide a wealth of information and examples. Cloudformation is completely free. Customers only need to pay for the AWS service provided by CloudFormation. Terraform is an open-source application that can be used for free. Terraform, on the other hand, has a paid enterprise version that includes additional collaboration and governance features.

- **Integration of Multiple Clouds:**
Terraform is the way to go if you want to provide services across multiple cloud platforms. While Terraform can be used with AWS, GCP, Azure, and other cloud providers, CloudFormation is only available on AWS. Cloudformation is not for you if you have multiple cloud installations. If you use AWS resources such as EC2, S3, and so on, you should use Cloudformation.


### Q. Are callbacks possible with Terraform on Azure ?
Answer: Yes. This is possible with Azure Event Hubs.

### Q. What is Terraform Directory?
Answer:Terraform Directory, which Terraform uses to manage cached provider plugins and modules, as well as to record which workspace is currently active and the last known backend configuration in case state needs to be migrated on the next run.

### Q. Is history the same as it is on the web while using TFS API to provide resources ?
Answer: Yes, the narration is similar to that found on the web because UI uses API as its foundation. Everything on the UI is available via other methods and the API.

### Q. What is a Private Module Registry?
Answer: Using the private module registry, Terraform Cloud users can create and confidentially share infrastructure modules within an organisation. The private module registry in Terraform Enterprise allows you to share modules within or across organisations.

### Q. Does Terraform support multi-provider deployments?
Answer: Terraform is a powerful tool in multi-provider deployments because it is not tied to a specific infrastructure or cloud provider. You can manage all resources with the same set of configuration files, sharing variables and defining dependencies across providers.

### Q. How is duplicate resource error ignored during terraform apply ?
Answer: 
- To stop managing those resources, remove them from your Terraform code.
- Remove the resources from the API (cloud provider) and recreate them using Terraform.
- Terraform those resources and remove the terraform code that is attempting to recreate them.
- Use terraform apply —target=xxx to apply only the resources you require.

### Q. What are some of the built-in provisioners available in Terraform?
Answer: 
- abspath.
- dirname.
- pathexpand.
- basename.
- file.
- fileexists.
- fileset.
- filebase64

### Q. What are the components of Terraform architecture?
Answer: 
- Sub-graphs
- Expression Evaluation
- Vertex Evaluation
- Graph Walk
- Graph Builder
- State Manager
- Configuration Loader
- CLI (Command Line interface)
- Backend

### Q. Define Resource Graph in Terraform
Answer: A resource graph is a graphical representation of the available resources. It enables the modification and creation of independent resources at the same time. Terraform creates a plan for the graph’s configuration in order to generate plans and refresh the state. It efficiently and effectively creates structure to help us understand the disadvantages.

### Q. Can you provide a few examples where we can use for Sentinel policies?
Answer: Sentinels are an effective way to implement a wide range of policies in Terraform. Here are a couple of examples:
- Enforce explicit resource ownership.
- Limit the roles that the cloud provider can play.
- Examine the audit trail for Terraform Cloud operations.
- Only certain resources, providers, or data sources may be prohibited.
- Make resource tagging mandatory.
- In the Private Module Registry, you can limit how modules are used.

### Q. What are the various levels of Sentinel enforcement?
Answer: Sentinel has three levels of enforcement: advisory, soft mandatory, and hard mandatory.

- Advisory : Logged in but permitted to pass. When a user initiates a plan that violates the policy, an advisory is issued.
- Soft Mandatory : Unless an override is specified, the policy must be followed. Overrides are only available to administrators.
- Hard Mandatory : The policy must be implemented regardless. Unless and until this policy is removed, it cannot be overridden. Terraform’s default enforcement level is this.

### Q. How to Store Sensitive Data in Terraform?
Answer: To communicate with your cloud provider’s API, Terraform requires credentials. However, these credentials are frequently saved in plaintext on your desktop. Every day, GitHub is exposed to thousands of API and cryptographic keys. As a result, your API keys should never be directly stored in Terraform code. To store passwords, TLS certificates, SSH keys, and anything else that shouldn’t be stored in plain text, use encrypted storage.

### Q. What is Terraform Core? Tell us some primary responsibilities of it
Answer: Terraform Core is a binary written in the Go programming language and statically compiled. The compiled binary provides Terraform users with an entry point. The primary responsibilities are as follows:

- Infrastructure’s code functionalities include module and configuration file reading and interpolation.
- Building a Resource Graph
- RPC-based plugin communication
- Plan implementation
- Resource state management

### Q. How will you upgrade plugins on Terraform?
Answer: Terraform providers are distributed separately from the Terraform binary since Terraform v0.10. This allows them to update at different rates while also allowing a larger group of people to collaborate on the providers. This is mostly positive, but it adds a new step for upgrading providers.

### Q. How will you control and handle rollbacks when something goes wrong?
ANswer: We will recommit the previous version of the code to my VCS as the new and current version. A terraform run will be triggered, which will be in charge of running the old code. Remember that terraform is more declarative. Check that the old code contains everything that was specified in the code for rollback.

Ensure that it is not destroyed when the old code is run due to a lack of these. If the state file becomes corrupted as a result of a recent Terraform run, I will use Terraform Enterprise’s State Rollback feature to roll back to the most recent good state. Because every state change is versioned, this could be done.

### Q. How can you define dependencies in Terraform?
Answer: You can use depends_on to declare the dependency explicitly. You can also specify multiple resources in the depends on argument, and Terraform will create the target resource after all of them have been created.

### Q. What is the external data block in Terraform?
Answer: The external data source allows an external programme to act as a data source by exposing arbitrary data for use elsewhere in the Terraform configuration by implementing a specific protocol.

### Q. What happens when multiple engineers start deploying infrastructure using the same state file?
Answer: Terraform has a critical feature known as “state locking.” This feature ensures that no changes to the state file are made during a run, preventing the state file from becoming corrupt. It is important to note that the state locking feature is not supported by all Terraform Backends. If this feature is required, you should select the appropriate backend.
[https://k21academy.com/terraform-iac/variables-in-terraform/](Terraform variable)

### Q. Which value of the TF_LOG variable provides the MOST verbose logging?
Answer: TRACE is the most verbose option, and it is the default if TF_LOG is not set to a log level name. When logging is enabled, you can set TF_LOG_PATH to force the log to always be appended to a specific file.

### Q. Which command can be used to preview the terraform execution plan?
Answer: The terraform plan command generates an execution plan, which allows you to preview the changes that Terraform intends to make to your infrastructure. When Terraform generates a plan by default, it:

- Reads the current state of any existing remote objects to ensure the Terraform state is current.
- The current configuration is compared to the previous state, and any differences are noted.
- Proposes a set of change actions that, if executed, should cause the remote objects to match the configuration.

### Q. Which command can be used to reconcile the Terraform state with the actual real-world infrastructure?
Answer: Terraform aids in the detection and management of drift. The state file stores information about the real-world state of Terraform-managed infrastructure. The command terraform refresh refreshes this state file, reconciling what Terraform believes is running and its configuration with what is actually running and configured.

### Q. What is the benefit of Terraform State? What is the benefit of using modules in terraform?
Answer: Terraform state is primarily used to store bindings between remote system items and resource instances specified in your configuration. When Terraform generates a remote object in response to a configuration change, it saves the remote object’s identification to a specific resource instance and may update or remove that object in response to future configuration changes.

We can save time and avoid costly errors by reusing configuration created by you, other members of your team, or other Terraform experts who have published modules for you to use.
